## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?

The introduction of different game mechanics sequentially, allows for the player to learn how to use and avoid different aspects of the game. For example the lone spike at the beginning of the game is an introduction to the mechanic and through experimentation the player will learn that touching the spike will make them lose a heart and give them a 5 second immunity to damage caused by spikes and other elements that inflict the same consequence. These mechanics that also inflict damage on the player, as it encourages player experimentation and experience the mechanics is a low stress environment before increasing the difficulty after the player has been introduced and learnt the mechanic. This empowers the player to discover how the make works and how to adapt to the increase of difficulty further into the game where the mechanic is used uniquely.  

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

The intensity curve slowly rises as the player progresses through the level and as the difficulty rises challenging the abilities of the player. The design of the level enables the game to increase intensity and emotional experience of the player together as the player progresses. The level design I have created models an example of how after moments of tension there is also relief. This can be seen in my level where after a high intensity situation of jumping over acid and between small spaces between spikes there is then a low intensity situation in the tunnels where the player is in a safe environment figuring out the puzzle involving the movable boxes. This visualises the intensity curve going from up to down depending on the situation the player is in. 

The dramatic arc is a diagram that allows for my level to be visualised in the ideal template on how to successfully design a level that follows good design practice and creates an enjoyable yet challenging experience for the player. 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

There are multiple challenges within my level that makes that player engage with the core mechanics of the game. These challenges are designed to test the player in all aspects, from skills to emotional but also allow a sense of accomplishment after the completion of sections that lean towards the harder end of the scale. In turn encouraging more nuanced control by the player to test their abilities and enable them to test if they will be able to complete more challenging obstacles. One main challenge that is embedded within my platformer is the traversing of the levels and avoiding falling off the level as it sets the player back forcing them to complete the seduction again until they gain sufficient skills to not only complete the section of the level they were stuck on but give them the ability to learn valued game skills to accomplish harder challenges in the game. Paired with this first challenge is the added challenge of including other mechanics like moving platforms, chompers and spitters that add another layer of difficulty that pushes a player to learn skills and make decisions based on how they want to play, encouraging new game dynamics. I designed the level so that after moments of difficulty and purposeful testing of player abilities there are pauses of difficulty where the player encounters sections that allow moments of relief such as the moving platforms or in parts of the tunnels where there is no danger.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?
My level’s design dictates the player's path completely in some sections of the level, especially within the first section of the level as the player is just starting out and is beginning to learn the core mechanics of the game. But there are parts within the level that facilitate self-exploration and the ability to choose their own path in specific areas of the level. Specifically in section 2 there is a sky scale that allows players to choose their own path, the path that is taken determines whether they collect everything that is offered within; the key that is located at the top of the scale and the health case that is easily spotted in the middle. This also determines how many enemy encounters the player faces and forces the player to face the consequences if they decide not to explore all routes available. For instance if the player decides to not explore and go directly to the otherside they won’t collect the second key in turn being unable to open the door at the end of the level.

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Checkpoints

The introduction of the checkpoint first allows players to be able to explore the upcoming mechanics without much consequence and respawn close. This also means that later on in the section the player can respawn in the correct spot. 
### 2.2. Spikes

Introducing  the first mechanic that inflicts damage on the player and because it is close to the checkpoint at the beginning of the level the player can experiment with the spike.  
### 2.3. Acid

Acid is another main damaging mechanic within the game so having it close to the first checkpoint allows for experimentation and how to adapt your basic skills for when the level difficulty gets harder.
### 2.4. Moving Platforms

The moving platform visualises the increase of difficulty of a mechanic and the player can explore how the moving platform works, and the speed and distance it goes.
### 2.5. Health Pickups

The need for health pickups aren’t needed until later in the level as there wasn't much doing damage to the player. The inclusion of the health pick up is where I believe players may begin to need more health.
### 2.6. Keys

This is where the first key is seen, which is at the end of the first section which is just an introduction to the game and its mechanics so it is seen before some of the other core mechanics.
### 2.7. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

This is the first weapon introduced which is seen before the enemies as it gives players the choice of each fighting the enemy or avoiding it.
### 2.8. Passthrough Platforms

This is where the level starts to get more difficult and more player skill is needed. This mechanic starts the parkour element of the level.
### 2.9. Chompers

The Chomper is added where it is solo and allows the player to experiment with the enemy and figure out the abilities of the Chomper; how strong it is and hit range, etc.
### 2.10. Spitters

The Spitter is introduced the same way as the Chomper allowing the player to experiment and determine its strength. This is also the time where the player will determine which enemy is a bigger threat: the Spitter or the Chomper.
### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

This mechanic is added last where the difficulty is increasing greatly and the need for more weapons becomes apparent to the player. Allows for different dynamics of play to merge when fighting enemies.
## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.
